            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep the chiles: Cut the stems off the guajillo and ancho chiles. Then shake out the inner seeds within each chile and place them into a large bowl. Cover the chiles with boiling water (ensuring they’re fully submerged) and set aside for the chiles to soak and rehydrate. Meanwhile, move on with the recipe.</li>
                <li>Brown the pork: In a large dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat, add the oil. When hot, gently swirl the pot around to evenly coat the bottom. Working in batches, add some of the pork chunks into the pot, careful not to overcrowd. Brown the pork until a nice sear appears, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Season the pork with salt/pepper- to taste. Transfer the browned pork onto a clean plate/small baking sheet and repeat the process until all the pork is browned. Then set the browned pork chunks aside and reduce the heat to medium.</li>
                <li>Sauté the aromatics: Add the chopped onion into the pot. Sauté, while stirring every so often, until the onions are tender, about 3-4 minutes. Then add the garlic and continue cooking until the mixture is fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Blend the chiles: Back to the soaked chiles, place the soaked chiles into the body of a high-powered blender or food processor along with 1 cup of the soaking liquid- do not discard remaining though. Pulse to combine until the chiles are completely smooth. Add in a splash more of the soaking liquid if the mixture is too thick (or to help swish/clean out the blender/processor).</li>
                <li>Afterward, transfer the browned pork into the pot with any residual juices that have been collected into a large slow cooker vessel (at least 6-quarts). Add the blended chile mixture into the pot along with the cumin, oregano, chipotle powder (if using), bay leaves, hominy, and broth. Stir until fully combined. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 4-5 hours- stirring the pozole every so often. Then serve with desired toppings.</li>
