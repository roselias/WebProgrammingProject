            <h2>About Our Recipes:</h2>
            <p>Our Recipes was created as a fun way to fulfill the project requirements for the Web Programming class at the
                University of Houston-Downtown, and a place to put all of our favorite recipes into one place! Spanning different
                categories, from crockpot recipes to pastas and all the way to desserts, we believe there is something for everyone!</p>
            <p>We hope you have half as much fun combing through, cooking and enjoying these recipes as we did compiling them!
            Thank you for stopping by!</p>
